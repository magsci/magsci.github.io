                <h3>A Level:
                    Why learn about experimental techniques?</h3><br><br>
                <p id = "subject"> Physics is an experimental subject.  While the subject content changes, the underlying principle of observation and measurement followed by analysis and evaluation applies to all aspects of the subject.
                    <br><br>

Therefore experimental design is vitally important; this involves the selection of suitable apparatus and identification of techniques for a proposed experiment. As part of the design, variables that must be controlled are identified.<br><br>


Throughout the course students should use a wide range of practical apparatus and techniques.<br><br> 

Collecting results, raw data and processing this data requires students to decide on appropriate units for measurements and in addition how to present their observations and data in an appropriate manner.<br><br>


Students should be able to decide how appropriate a particular experimental method is in meeting the expected outcomes. This might be their own method or a method developed by somebody else.

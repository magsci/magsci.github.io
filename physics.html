                    Throughout the course students should use a wide range of practical apparatus and techniques.<br><br> Collecting results, raw data and processing this data requires students to decide on appropriate units for measurements and in addition how to present their observations and data in an appropriate manner.<br><br>
                    Students should be able to decide how appropriate a particular experimental method is in meeting the expected outcomes. This might be their own method or a method developed by somebody else.

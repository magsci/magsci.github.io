            <div id = "subb"><p id = "info"><br>The <span style="font-style: italic"> climate pages</span> explore our current understanding of the climate crisis by considering the nature of the challenge and the underlying concepts. The aim is to develop an improved understanding of these issues using the underlying basic science.
                <br><p id = "info1"> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> If we all carry on behaving as usual then by 2100 the increase in the average temperature of the Earth since 1970 will be about 3.5<sup>o</sup>C. In fact, we have already experienced over 1<sup>o</sup>C of warming and are about half way to 2<sup>o</sup>C. This will lead to sea level rise, water shortages, food shortages and extreme weather events. We are currently seeing some of these damaging effects on our climate. It turns out that a 2<sup>o</sup>C rise has never been seen, so the effects are likely to be even worse that those listed above and conditions on Earth may not be habitable.<br>For there to be hope of a sustainable and healthy planet, action is needed now. The temperature is set by the total amount of carbon accumulated in the atmosphere; 1000Gton of carbon will lead to a rise of 2<sup>o</sup>C, while 500Gton results in 1<sup>o</sup>C. We have already put in 500Gton, so it is important that we do not ever exceed 1000Gton. We need to decarbonize.<br>This can be achieved by cutting emissions at a steady rate each year and the sooner we start the easier that will be. Cutting emissions means using carbon-free sources of energy and also reducing emissions in transportation, industry agriculture and buildings. Many of these can be done by being more efficient. In the longer-term new carbon free energy solutions will be needed.<br>By 2100 the carbon-free energy needs of the earth is expected to be 20Twatts. This will be a huge challenge as we currently use about 13Twatts of energy which is not carbon free. Nuclear power might seem a good way forward. However, to meet the size of the challenge a thousand new power plants would be needed, a couple a week for 100 years. This is not practical. Currently new ideas are being considered, for example, using solar cells built on the moon to radiate microwave energy back to earth, using windmills in the jet stream or solar thermal energy.<br>Achieving all this will be hard as many of these technologies are not in place, but by using the shorter-term measures to try to stabilize the temperature there may be enough time to develop these to decarbonise the energy system by 2100.<br>

        <h2>POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACK</h2> <br> 

        <div id = "subb"><p id = "info"><br>If you change something and the change that you see is bigger than expected then there is likely positive feedback at work. Positive feedback is a way of amplifying things. On the other hand, if there is negative feedback then the change is reduced. This tends to stabilise things or keep things the same.<br>A couple of simple examples show how these can work. On your birthday you might expect to get a present from your friend. If that friend tells all their friends to give you a present, then the number of presents is a lot bigger than you expected or is amplified. The number of friends of the friend acts as positive feedback.<br>
</p>
            <br>
            <p id = "info"> Alternatively, if you play sport, for example a sport where you run a lot and get very hot, you might find that you perspire or sweat which will then cool you down. This is an example of negative feedback as the perspiration when it evaporates reduces your body temperature back to normal. The hotter you get the more you perspire which cools you down more.

        <h2>..</h2> <br> <br>
        <div id = "subb">
            <br>
            
            <p id= "info">Feedback is really important if you want things to stay the same, like for example, the temperature of our Earth. So, any increase that triggers an additional increase in temperature of the Earth is an example of positive feedback. For example, the warming due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes ice and snow to melt. Snow and ice cool our planet by reflecting sunlight away and if there is less ice and snow there will be less energy reflected or more reaching the Earthâ€™s surface and the hotter we become. This is an additional warming effect to that caused by the carbon dioxide. It is positive feedback and needs to be avoided in this situation.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p id= "info">In a nutshell, feedback is when the change you get is bigger or smaller than expected. Positive feedback usually makes that change bigger as it acts in the same direction and so it adds to the initial change, while negative feedback makes the change smaller, as it acts in the opposite direction thereby reducing the overall change. </p>

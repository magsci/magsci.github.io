            <p id = "info"> These webpages represent what I have learnt by considering the basic science and also using simple modelling techniques. Their purpose is to consolidate and help drive my understanding forward and also to share with anybody who is interested. I have tried to keep to simple concepts and I am aware that there are many websites with more detailed and accurate information on this subject.  I have tried to present material which is based on what I have written and or have studied, but clearly the underlying mathematical theory has been in the public domain and has been presented and developed by many authors. I have included references to authors whose equations I have quoted, and as far as I am aware their documents are in the public domain.<br>

            <p id= "info">In addition, I would like to explore the impact of increased carbon dioxide levels on other parts of the atmosphere such as the ionosphere and its consequences for global communications.<br><br>Finally, an area that I would like to address is the Earth after carbon dioxide has finally reduced in the long-term future. This may be a period where human life no longer exists. </p>
